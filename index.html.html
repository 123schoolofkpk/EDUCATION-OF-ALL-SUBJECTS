	<p>: School is the place where we start our learning. Apart from learning to read, write, and excel in academics, the school also teaches us valuable life lessons that we can incorporate in our daily lives. It is the place where the foundation of our knowledge and morals are laid. So let’s look at some of the things that are worth remembering about our schools.</p>
	<h2>SCHOOL</h2>
	<p>The foundations of our learning are laid by our schools. School is the place that instills in us a sense of responsibility and hardworking spirit. We become better versions of ourselves through the rigorous tests that we are put through at schools. Each exam, each activity, and each lesson is aimed towards making us learn and grow. Right from the beginning, we are taught to be morally responsible for all our actions.

The various subjects introduce us to the world’s diversity and allow us to explore our surroundings with a unique perspective. We never know what problems await us when we grow up; schools are the training grounds that prepare us to face the unknown. We can overcome any hardship with the right motivation, and schools do that for us. We are not only taught to be responsible citizens but also hardworking individuals who strive hard to face the challenges that life throws at us.. A good student is the product of a good school. My school has excellent teachers who help students with studies, sports, and other extracurricular activities. They are the building blocks of aa school and teach us important lessons that we must apply in our daily lives.

Schools teach us to cooperate with our friends and classmates. The basic value of sharing is taught right from the beginning. We have different classrooms where the teachers teach us different subjects. Equal weightage is given to both studies and co-curricular activities so that we develop into better individuals. Our schools will always try to focus on our overall growth and transform us into healthy adults.</p>
